# Invoice Sync and Table Display Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Client Display Issue
**Problem**: Clients were not being properly created from Xero contacts due to field name mismatches.

**Solution**: 
- Updated the client creation logic in `backend/services/xeroService.js` to use correct field names that match the Client model schema
- Added proper field mapping:
  - `name` → `name`
  - `EmailAddress` → `invoiceEmail` and `contact1Email`
  - `PhoneNumber` → `contact1Number`
  - Added fallback values for required fields
- Added error handling for client creation failures
- Improved client lookup to search by both name and email

### 2. Limited Invoice Display (Only 14 invoices showing)
**Problem**: Frontend was filtering to show only unpaid invoices by default.

**Solution**:
- Changed `showPaidInvoices` default state from `false` to `true` in `frontend/src/scenes/invoices/index.jsx`
- Increased DataGrid page size from 10 to 25 rows
- Added more pagination options: [10, 25, 50, 100]

### 3. Invoice Model Validation
**Problem**: Client field was conditionally required, causing validation issues.

**Solution**:
- Made client field optional for all invoices in `backend/models/Invoice.js`
- This allows Xero invoices to be created even when client creation fails

### 4. Improved Error Handling and Logging
**Solution**:
- Added detailed logging during invoice processing
- Added progress tracking (logs every 10 processed invoices)
- Added error counting and summary
- Added try-catch blocks around client creation

## Files Modified

1. `backend/services/xeroService.js`
   - Fixed client creation field mapping
   - Added error handling for client creation
   - Improved client lookup logic
   - Added detailed logging and progress tracking

2. `frontend/src/scenes/invoices/index.jsx`
   - Changed default filter to show all invoices (paid and unpaid)
   - Increased page size and added pagination options

3. `backend/models/Invoice.js`
   - Made client field optional for all invoices

## Testing Instructions

1. **Restart the backend server** to apply the changes
2. **Test Xero sync**:
   - Go to the invoices page
   - Click "Sync with Xero" button
   - Check the console logs for detailed progress information
   - Verify that clients are being created properly

3. **Test invoice display**:
   - Verify that all invoices (paid and unpaid) are now visible
   - Check that client names are displayed correctly
   - Test pagination with different page sizes

4. **Check database**:
   - Verify that new clients are created with proper field mapping
   - Check that invoices are associated with correct clients

## Expected Results

- All invoices from Xero should now sync properly
- Client names should display correctly in the invoice table
- More than 14 invoices should be visible (depending on total count)
- Better error handling and logging for debugging
- Improved pagination options for better user experience
