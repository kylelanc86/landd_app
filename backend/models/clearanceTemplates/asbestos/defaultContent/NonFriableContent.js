  backgroundInformationContent: "Following completion of non-friable asbestos removal works undertaken by a suitably licenced Asbestos Removal Contractor, a clearance inspection must be completed by an independent LAA / a competent person. The clearance inspection includes an assessment of the following:\n\n• Visual inspection of the work area for asbestos dust or debris\n• Visual inspection of the adjacent area including the access and egress pathways for visible asbestos dust and debris\n\nIt is required that a Non-Friable Clearance Certificate be issued on completion of a successful inspection. The issuer needs to ensure:\n\n• This certificate should be issued prior to the area being re-occupied. This chain of events should occur regardless of whether the site is a commercial or residential property.\n• The asbestos removal area and areas immediately surrounding it are visibly clean from asbestos contamination\n• The removal area does not pose a risk to health safety and safety from exposure to asbestos",

  nonFriableClearanceCertificateLimitationsTitle: "NON-FRIABLE CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE LIMITATIONS",
  nonFriableClearanceCertificateLimitationsContent: "The visual clearance inspection was only carried out in the locations outlined within this document. L&D did not inspect any areas of the property that fall outside of the locations listed in this certificate and therefore make no comment regarding the presence or condition of other ACM that may or may not be present. When undertaking the inspection, the LAA tries to inspect as much of the asbestos removal area as possible. However, no inspection is absolute. Should suspect ACM be identified following the inspection, works should cease until an assessment of the materials is completed.",
