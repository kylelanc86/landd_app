# Paid Invoice Cleanup Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds automatic cleanup of paid invoices to maintain a clean database that only contains unpaid invoices for reference purposes.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Xero Sync Service (`backend/services/xeroService.js`)

**Added cleanup logic to the sync process:**
- New `cleanupPaidInvoices()` method that identifies invoices no longer in Xero results
- Automatically soft deletes invoices that are no longer returned by Xero API
- Runs after each sync to maintain database cleanliness

**Key changes:**
```javascript
// Added to syncInvoicesFromXero() method
const cleanupResult = await this.cleanupPaidInvoices(validInvoices);
console.log(`Cleanup completed: ${cleanupResult.softDeleted} invoices soft deleted`);
```

### 2. Cleanup Scripts

**`backend/scripts/cleanupPaidInvoices.js`**
- One-time cleanup script for existing paid invoices
- Marks all paid invoices as soft deleted
- Provides detailed reporting of cleanup results

**`backend/scripts/checkSpecificInvoices.js`**
- Diagnostic script to check specific invoice status
- Useful for troubleshooting specific invoices like LDJ04107-5 and LDJ04205

### 3. API Endpoint (`backend/routes/xero.js`)

**New endpoint: `POST /xero/cleanup-paid-invoices`**
- Manual cleanup trigger from frontend
- Soft deletes all paid invoices in database
- Returns detailed results

### 4. Frontend Integration (`frontend/src/scenes/invoices/index.jsx`)

**Added cleanup button and functionality:**
- "CLEANUP PAID INVOICES" button in Xero section
- `handleCleanupPaidInvoices()` function
- Automatic refresh of invoice list after cleanup

## How It Works

### Automatic Cleanup (During Sync)
1. **Fetch unpaid invoices** from Xero (AUTHORISED, SUBMITTED status)
2. **Process and save** current unpaid invoices
3. **Identify invoices to cleanup**: Find invoices in database with Xero IDs that are not in current results
4. **Soft delete** invoices no longer in Xero results (likely marked as paid)
5. **Log results** for monitoring

### Manual Cleanup
1. **Find all paid invoices** in database that aren't already soft deleted
2. **Mark as soft deleted** with reason and timestamp
3. **Return results** to user

## Usage

### Immediate Cleanup (One-time)
```bash
# Run the cleanup script
cd backend
node scripts/cleanupPaidInvoices.js
```

### Check Specific Invoices
```bash
# Check specific invoices mentioned by user
cd backend
node scripts/checkSpecificInvoices.js
```

### Frontend Cleanup
1. Go to Invoices page
2. Click "CLEANUP PAID INVOICES" button
3. Confirm the action

### Automatic Cleanup
- Runs automatically after each Xero sync
- No user intervention required
- Maintains database cleanliness

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Only syncs unpaid invoices, keeping API calls minimal
2. **Scalability**: Performance doesn't degrade with invoice volume
3. **Clean UI**: Users only see relevant unpaid invoices
4. **Data Integrity**: Maintains soft delete history for audit purposes
5. **Automatic**: No manual intervention required for ongoing maintenance

## Monitoring

The system provides detailed logging:
- Number of invoices cleaned up
- Specific invoice IDs being soft deleted
- Error reporting for failed operations
- Summary of remaining active invoices

## Future Considerations

- The cleanup process is designed to be safe and reversible
- Soft deleted invoices can be restored if needed
- All cleanup operations are logged with reasons and timestamps
- The system maintains data integrity while providing clean user experience
