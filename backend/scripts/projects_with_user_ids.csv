Upon arrival, the demolition of one room at the end of the house had already begun. There was asbestos debris in the garden below the work area and all around a skip bin nearby. A blue tarp had been stapled/nailed onto the side of the house where the removal/demolition had already occurred and so an inspection beneath was limited to where the tarp could be lifted. Given the rainy conditions and not knowing what the material was like beneath, the tarp was not fully removed. A tile bedding strip could not be found still attached to the house in this location, however debris found in the garden below and around the skip was consisted with TBS and eaves. A sample of the eaves was taken from the planned demolition area that had not yet been touched.

Depending on your scope of works, the mould impacted materials should be removed and disposed of while semi-porous surfaces and non-porous surfaces can be cleaned. Timber framework and the like will require abrasive cleaning to achieve clearance. From the point of removal work completion, the air scrubbers should be allowed to run for 24 hours prior to our attendance for clearance. Dehumidifiers may also be required if retained building materials need to be dried.

We can attend at the start of the project to ensure the above is installed / achieved however this would be outside our current allowance.

 

Clearance assessment should occur 24 hours after the removal works have been completed to ensure airborne mould spores have been filtered out, this will help achieve clearance at 1st attempt. The clearance inspection will comprise of:

1.	A visual inspection to confirm all moulds / mould impacted materials have been removed, and moisture source eliminated.
2.	Moisture measurements to demonstrate all materials have been suitably dried.
3.	Air samples, to confirm the absence of mould spores.

29/04/2025 - Note: Pauline is agitated by 'how long' this has taken. We were originally contacted at COB (4pm) on 16/04, before a series of long weekends and busy. We likely would not have been able to attend much sooner anyway. I (Mel) made clear to Pauline that we could not attend by the next business day and availability was low, but we would do our best to attend asap. Due to miscommunication between agent/Mel/Pauline attendance has been slightly delayed (agent left a voicemail on our office phone at 4.55pm 16/4).",,,,68ae588af3fbccfd9cb8eb26,No,No,Kelsey Shepherd,29/04/2025 9:41,

Quote for Hazardous Materials assessment 73 Bonython St Downer 
Hi Team, 
I am planning an extension to my house, built 1962 - previous building 
reports hadn't included much in the way of commentary on potential 
hazardous materials so seeking an inspection and sampling of: 
1. Eaves 
2. Trim/Flashing on gable ends 
3. Bathroom wall (fibre cement appearance) 
4. Bathroom floor tiles 
5. Existing garage built ~1982 but renovated ~2008 
Could you please provide a quote for the above and current availability for 
inspections? 
Kind Regards, 
Gavin

Mould, Lead Paint & Asbestos

Please engage a suitably qualified consultant to test for suspected mould, lead paint and asbestos and provide remediation scope of works if required.
Locations - highlighted on attached map
-  Yellow:  One area with suspected white mould in the First Aid Room
-  Orange:  Multiple areas to be tested for lead paint - mostly external or covered walkways but one is internal.  There is also a large area of external rails around the Chauvel Street carpark (currently blue and yellow), which need to be tested.  The boiler room door needs to be tested for both lead paint and asbestos and the steps for just lead paint.
-  Blue:  Multiple areas of coloured external sheeting that is suspected asbestos, need to ensure it is encapsulated so all can be painted.  The boiler room door needs to be tested for both lead paint and asbestos.
Attached PDF of CAD file with building and room numbers for report.

LDJ02884,Torrens Primary School,68b837b2ae58dc87ae6bb0d7,Asbestos & HAZMAT,Job complete,"Ritchie Street, Torrens, Australian Capital Territory, 2607, Australia",,HAZ 23-24/392,Other,,"This job # started as a mould validation assessment under HAZ 23-24/392, following the initial assessment under an earlier job #. The validation assessment failed due to mould contamination in the wall structure. Unexpected suspect asbestos was identified when floor tiles were lifted resulting in an MA report (no asbestos detected).  

The school sought further assessment of other classrooms to clarify mould risk - this turned into another assessment report with site meetings to discuss outcomes. 

Site meetings identified external drainage as an ongoing risk to further potential moisture ingress; ACT PG are working on this prior to furthering any mould remediation work which is likely to take some time.

Please invoice the job as per the below and we'll start another job # when the remediation works recommence:

               - Asbestos sample analysis (urgent): x 2

These doors will require removal and subsequent replacement as part of my external painting program. I have attached previous reports for reference however I do not believe that these particular doors have been previously captured.

Hi, 

I was talking with Julia earlier today. 

Can I please get a price for someone at L&D consulting to go to site tomorrow and take 1 x sample of the Roof Tile Backing board (on the edge of the gable roof under the concrete roof tile – see photos) to test at a NATA accredited lab for suspected Asbestos (ACM)? 

A tree branch fell on the owners roof impacting the roof tile and suspected ACM. It’s a single story property and the owner NICOLAS BUCHHOLZ 0455942080 is available between 10am to 12pm tomorrow – Friday 28/09/2023. Kindly call the owner upon approach. 

I just need a price for the Lab test results only emailed to me, no formal Asbestos report at this stage, plus call out fee if you can help me?. 

Thank you!",,,,68524b1d20898fb103428b3d,No,No,"Jordan Smith

Good afternoon 

We have purchased a house where the building inspection reported loose fill 
insulation in the roof. The report indicates that while asbestos is 
unlikely, given the age of the house and the loose fill nature of the 
insulation we would like to have an assessment done to provide us with 
certainty as to the nature of the insulation. 

Grateful for your advice on organising and inspection/testing.

With the wall cavities, the Hygienist can break into the space to allow testing – an invasive inspection.

Following review of test data, the Hygienist is to provide a comprehensive and detailed Scope of Works for the remediation of the property. This is to include specific comment on the decontamination / remediation / removal of various materials (plasterboard, wood framing..) as well as confirmation of the timing of additional inspections prior to the areas contaminated being closed. This is important as otherwise the builder may try to enclose spaces before they are inspected and certified by the Hygienist.

The Hygienist will then issue a final report and certification that the mould has been removed.

Hope this is ok, it’ll be a full day trip so I put it a couple of weeks away. They are getting their boiler replaced but its pretty old so wanting to check it for asbestos first. I told him there would be a travel fee included and he said that would be fine.

Hi there,

I have recently purchased a property in Binalong (near Yass). It's 1880s construction, but has a newer fake ceiling + entry gate that look to me like asbestos. I would like a quote for the assessment and removal of any asbestos found, if you are able to service this property.
